Continuous Delivery
-------------------

Continuous delivery is setup as follows:
1. Each commit triggers a build on [Travis CI], which runs linting (`composer test`) and all tests (`composer test`)
2. If the commit belongs to the `master` branch, deployment is done on the **staging** platform.
3. If the commit is a `tag`, deployment is done on the **production** platform.

See [.travis.yml] for details.
